		a huge learning experience for me. (P.S it does not work in Chrome sadly, so you will have to use another browser.)</h3>

		<h2>Animal Welfare</h2>
		<h3>If I wasn't Computer Science, I would be a Veterinarian! I love animals and hope to one day 
		use my coding/software development to further research fossils/living animals and help the well being 
		of animals in general.</h3>
		<h2>Education</h2>
		<h3>I don't have a teaching license, but I would love to teach and help further progression in 
		teaching. I enjoy helping people with their Java homework at school and teaching the basics to people 
		who have never coded before. It's always good to teach because both the student and the teacher learn!</h3>
		<h2>Space</h2>
		<h3>I am not ready to make software that would help the future of space travel, but maybe one day! 
		I find space (broad term) very fascinating, and I hope to one day help progress the future of space 
		travel and help find extra terrestrial life! (If there is any)</h3>
		<h2>Environment</h2>
		<h3>I am very passionate about the environment and the well being of the planet. I am a firm 
		believer of Climate Change and I hope to use my work to protect the Earth. If not with my Computer Science skills, 
		then with any of my other skills! I hope to help clean up the trash and find a way to make reusable energy 
		efficient and widespread throughout the world and try to fix the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.</h3>
		<h2>Video Games</h2>
		<h3>Creating video games for a living has been a life long dream of mine since I was a kid. 
		It's practically the reason I became a Computer Science major! Working in the video game industry 
		has always been a dream, and I hope to improve on my coding and try to get into the industry someday.</h3>

		<h2>Pet Volunteer</h2>
		<h3>Iowa City Animal Center | May 2014 - August 2014</h3>
		<h4>I would visit the animal center and play with the cats or walk the dogs, and give them human interaction. 
		It helped them become more sociable to humans and easier to adopt. 
		It also helps with animal stress when they are visited by volunteers. 
		I Had to stop because school/work was taking up too much time, but I hope to volunteer again when time becomes more available!
		</h4>
		
		<h2>App Developer</h2>
		<h3>Mary Welsh Elementary School | October 2016</h3>
		<h4>I helped the 5th-6th grade Lego Team of Mary Welsh Elementary create a dog walking app through BuildFire. 
		I helped write some HTML, CSS, and Javascript code to make the app look and function like they wanted. Really smart kids! 
		They didn't need much help.</h4>

		<h1>Working Out</h1>
		<h3>I have always been a physical person. I workout every weekday and do a lot of 
		outdoor activities! I am currently being certified to Scuba Dive, and love to rock climb 
		and watch/play Soccer(Football)(Arsenal 4 Life)</h3>
		
		<h1>Rubik's Cubes</h1>
		<h3>It's a weird hobby, I know, but Rubik's Cubes are one of my favorite things to do! I have over 20 different cubes 
		and can solve all (most?) of them. If you ever want to start, all it takes is one(many) tutorial(s) on YouTube! 
		Anyone can do it, you just have to learn how! (PS the theme of this website is Rubik's Cube themed. Lame I know)</h3>
		<h3>Top Five Cubes</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>3x3 Cube</li>
			<li>4x4 Cube</li>
			<li>Curvy Copter</li>
			<li>3x3x5 Cuboid</li>
			<li>Gear Mastermorphix</li>
		
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Hardest Cube Solved- Ghost Cube</h3>
		
		<h1>Video Games</h1>
		
		<h3>I am super into Rocket League right now, but also play many story driven video games. 
		The Last of Us is a masterpiece, and I've always been a fan of Naughty Dog games. 
		I try to keep up with all video games and play as much as time permits!</h3>
		<h3>Currently Playing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Resident Evil 1</li>
			<li>The Witness</li>
			<li>Rocket League</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Coding</h1>
		<h3>Although I don't have much time to code, I do love to do it! Why else would I have 
		made this website?</h3>
		
		<h1>Card Games</h1>
		<h3>I love to watch and play games such as Hearthstone and Yu-Gi-Oh. It's very nerdy, but I 
		love the strategy and hard thinking behind card games! I'm not very good, so that's why I watch. 
		I also enjoy drinking card games, can't go wrong with that!(Guinness is preferred beer)</h3>
